                    <p>I'm Alex Lew, an aspiring UX/PM professional! I am currently looking for positions where I can research and drive user-centered design. My interests lie in solving, researching, and predicting where users might have issues.

                       I am currently a student employee with Creative Communications at the University of Washington, specifically working with the IT & IS team for the on-campus printing service called Dawgprints. We work directly with customers and troubleshoot our on-campus systems. I have been spearheading the kiosk redesign and MobilePrint feature.

                    The wizard fills a gap in the information architecture of the CarMax website and helps users build a list of candidate cars, as well as find similar cars to their candidates.  </p>

                  <h5> Process </h5>
                  <p> To redesign the information architecture and design, we first wanted to pinpoint where users had the most problem. We interviewed several university students and recorded them attempting to choose a car on the current website.
                    We then looked at what competitors used and how their sites worked. I was in charge of analyzing competitor websites and designing a new user flow.
                    After my teammates finished their interviews and heuristic evaluations, I worked with them to redesign the website. I drove the idea of using a wizard to allow students to input their needs and see what cars the wizard can find.
                    In the end, I helped design the wizard wireframe according to some of our other features that we designed.

                      <p> DawgPrints Mobile Print was a feature that was created during my work at UW-IT Creative Communications, where we managed the printing system for the entirety of the University of Washington. We found that many students would have trouble printing from their own computers and found that logging into the UW system just to print was a hassle. We formulated this idea in order to circumvent these to troubles: installing drivers to print and having to go to a library to log in and print a file.
                        What we built was a program that would monitor an email and then forward the attachment to our printing system.

                      <p> Because we were working with UW-IT, and we already had the greenlight to build this, as well as having some of the research resources at hand, we didn't really have to do a lot of research. We already received a lot of feedback through our support ticket system, which was almost entirely answered for through the three of us. We already knew user pain points through our own use of the system as well as feedback from the support tickets. So we built a Java program that would check for a new email and then send it to our print system, which would then allow a user to print from any kiosk on campus.

                              Due to the high number of different modules that made up our product, my mentor wanted me to own the feature of building an internal dashboard that would allow the developer leads to easily see the status of each of the latest commits. Each module keeps track of one of the modules code commits and allows for deeper analysis by showing code test status and

                            <p> As an intern, my first goal was to understand our product and understand that processes that each team goes through. To do this, I spoke with all of the developers in my team, and then worked my way through some of the devs from every other team, and spoke with the leads of each team.
                              After understanding each team's goals, processes, and function in the product, I then went and asked each dev lead  what they imagined the dashboard would be like, noting points where they identified important parts. I also spoke with developers, as they were the ones who were going to be providing the information that goes on the dashboard, about how their commits work and how to display certain information.
                              After I gathered all of this information, I developed a wireframe based on the current system as a proof of concept and presented it to our UX team. I was able to work with a UX intern to iterate across our scenarios and wireframe to build what you can see today.

                                <p> We had a fairly good idea of what was wrong with the UW registration system based on word-of-mouth, our own opinions, and general opinions of it from people in our class.
                                  We talked about it with other students in our class and they echoed the same concerns: it was too hard to navigate, not intuitive, didn't filter things by classes they needed or wanted.
                                  Thus, for our final project, we decided we would create an ideal/newly envisioned form of the registration system.
                                  We knew that having visual indicators and smart degree knowledge was key from user analysis.
                                  We also looked at how the UW registration system worked and how we could improve upon the entire experience, from displaying classes to finding classes that students needed.
                                  Once our research was done, we synthesized our ideas and looked at possible ways to display classes.
                                  We eventually settled on a visual year system that would allow students to click and 'register' for a class.
