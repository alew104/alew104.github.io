                    <p>The Carmax car finder wizard is a tool that was created by a team of 4 for our UX and IA class. We designed a wizard that would work alongisde the many different ways that people access information on the CarMax website. The wizard fills a gap in the information architecture of the CarMax website and helps users build a list of candidate cars, as well as find similar cars to their candidates.  </p>

                    <p> For the class we were assigned a persona (Michelle) that was similar to a college student: a person with a small budget and who's decisions were largely influenced by her parents. Since we were assigned a persona with specific identifiers, we were able to immediately look for people to interview. Due to being on a university campus, we were able to find many people who fit our target persona easily.
                    We interviewed two students, and identified their info flow and drop-off points, as well as pain points. Since the persona fit most university students, we felt that we could also use our own experiences to help guide our product. 
                    We also looked at other competitor websites 
                    We developed a wizard that would allow Michelle to build a candidate list of cars and show them to her parents for further investigation. </p>
