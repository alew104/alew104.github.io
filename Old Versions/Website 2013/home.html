        <h3>Hi there!</h3>
 
        <p>I'm Alex Lew, an aspiring UX/PM professional! I am currently looking for positions where I can research and drive user-centered design. My interests lie in solving, researching, and predicting where users might have issues.</p>

        <p>I am currently a student employee with Creative Communications at the University of Washington, specifically working with the IT &#38; IS team for the on-campus printing service called Dawgprints. We work directly with customers and troubleshoot our on-campus systems. I have been spearheading the kiosk redesign and MobilePrint feature.</p>
